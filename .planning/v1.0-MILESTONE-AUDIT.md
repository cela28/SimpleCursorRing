# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-06
**Status:** tech_debt (no blockers, documentation gaps only)

## Requirements Coverage

All v1 requirements satisfied:

| ID | Requirement | Phase | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| RING-01 | Ring displays around cursor and follows mouse | 1 | SATISFIED | Core.lua OnUpdate handler |
| RING-02 | Ring size adjustable via slider (20-200px) | 1 | SATISFIED | Settings.lua slider → Core.lua UpdateRingSize |
| RING-03 | Ring color customizable via color picker | 1 | SATISFIED | Settings.lua color picker → Core.lua UpdateRingColor |
| RING-04 | Option to use player's class color | 1 | SATISFIED | Settings.lua checkbox → Core.lua SetUseClassColor |
| SETT-01 | Settings via /simplecursorring slash command | 2 | SATISFIED | Settings.lua:209-214 slash commands |
| SETT-02 | Settings via Interface Options panel | 2 | SATISFIED | Settings.lua:202-203 RegisterCanvasLayoutCategory |

**Score: 6/6 requirements satisfied**

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Verification |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1 - Core Ring | Complete | VERIFIED (7/7 must-haves) |
| 2 - Settings UI | Code complete, not formally executed via GSD | NO VERIFICATION.md |

**Score: 1/2 phases formally verified**

## Integration Check

| Connection | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Core.lua → Settings.lua API wiring | 4/4 exports consumed |
| TOC load order | Correct (Core.lua before Settings.lua) |
| SavedVariables flow | Fully wired |
| Event ordering (ADDON_LOADED → PLAYER_LOGIN) | Correct, no race conditions |
| Texture files ↔ code paths | All present |
| Blizzard API usage | Correct patterns |

**Score: 6/6 E2E flows complete**

### E2E Flows Verified

1. `/scr` → settings panel opens with current values
2. Size slider drag → ring resizes immediately
3. Color swatch click → picker opens → ring recolors
4. Class color toggle → ring switches color source
5. Texture dropdown → ring texture changes
6. `/reload` → all settings persist

## Tech Debt

### Phase 02-settings-ui
- Phase 2 code was implemented outside GSD workflow (committed directly)
- No `02-01-SUMMARY.md` or `02-VERIFICATION.md` generated
- ROADMAP.md still shows Phase 2 as "Planned" though code is complete

### Quick Task 001
- Texture selection feature added but not in original REQUIREMENTS.md
- `SimpleCursorRing.textureOptions` exported but unused by Settings.lua (intentional — Core provides paths, Settings provides labels)
- Original `Ring.tga` file still on disk but not referenced by `textureOptions` table (orphaned asset)

### Total: 5 items across 2 areas

## Anti-Patterns

None found. No TODOs, FIXMEs, stubs, or placeholders in codebase.

## Summary

All v1 requirements are satisfied. The addon is functionally complete with all features working end-to-end. The only debt is documentation: Phase 2 was implemented outside the GSD workflow, so it lacks formal execution artifacts. This does not affect functionality.
